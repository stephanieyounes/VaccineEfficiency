# VaccineEfficiency :syringe:
**An analysis of the efficiency of the COVID-19 vaccine with the use of data from many different countries around the world! This data includes daily vaccinations, cases, deaths, hospitalization, and much more info about the countries themselves like population, median age, etc. With this information, we created a python script analyzing how effective the vaccine has been from March 2021 to October 2021 on these countries **

## 3 Methods
:one: Compare country's vaccination data to number of day- to-day cases data from March 2021 to October 2021 to analyze how the vaccine impacts covid cases. (Eric)<br />
:two: Comparing the vaccination count to the virusâ€™ mortality rate of these countries. (Steph)<br />
:three: Impact the vaccine has on the hospitalization rate of countries. (Natalie)<br />
